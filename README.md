**GhubScan** is an OSINT tool specifically designed to collect public information about GitHub users. This tool utilizes GitHub's public APIs to extract various data about a user, including: 

- 📧 **Email**
- 🆔 **User ID**
- 📝 **Name**
- 🔑 **Username**
- 🔗 **Link to GitHub profile**
- 📂 **Number of repositories**
- 👥 **Number of followers**
- 👤 **Number of following users**

GhubScan relies on GitHub's **public APIs** [API 1](https://api.github.com/users/banaxou/events/public) and [API 2](https://api.github.com/banaxou/exemple) to extract this information. It allows you to retrieve a user's email along with other important data. This tool is useful for OSINT research or for getting an overview of publicly accessible information via a user’s GitHub profile
